<!-- What you see in all of these documents for the second homework assignment is the product of a sort of "mad scramble" of effort, too close to deadline time. This is plainly apparent in the (attempted) Bootstrap portion of the work. A wholly unexpected death occurred in our family, and this had quite a deleterious time-consuming effect, leading to this "scramble." I did consider using one of the couple of homework "passes," but ultimately decided to do what I could, and keep those "passes" available for later in the course. I offer my apologies. What is presented here is not my best work. As the saying goes, "it is what it is." You can expect much better output from me, as this whole enterprise continues, even if I'm increasingly sure I'm not meant to specialize in front-end work. -->

				<h1>About Me</h1>

			    <img src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			    <p>After a couple of decades in broadcasting, I've decided to carry on as a professional communicator, but with very different media. For years, I was a prominent radio voice of afternoon-evening "drive-time" in Huntsville, Alabama. Now in Atlanta, I spend my time creating digital media presentations to inform, entertain, and effectively market the offerings of my clients.</p>

			    <p>I welcome you to explore my development work, and to contact me with any questions. Your interest is greatly appreciated.</p>
